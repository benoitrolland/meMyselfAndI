<!--

    The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
    If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.

    So in the example below it'll be `step-2`.

    The hash part of the url when this step is active will be `#/step-2`.

    You can also use `#step-2` in a link, to point directly to this particular step.

    Please note, that while `#/step-2` (with slash) would also work in a link it's not recommended.
    Using classic `id`-based links like `#step-2` makes these links usable also in fallback mode.
